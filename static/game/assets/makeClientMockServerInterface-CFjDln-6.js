From there, the only way to satisfy the halfplanes is to arrange the \`*R\` in the center, the \`(6)\`s at the edges of the board, and the halfplanes right next to the \`*R\` pointing outward. There are two valid arrangements of those halfplanes: one with \`2/nw\` above the \`*R\`, and one with \`2/ne\` above the \`*R\`.\\n\\n<BlocksPuzzleBoard blocks={\\"2/ne 2/nw 2/se 2/sw *R (6) (6) (6) (6)\\".split(\\" \\")} locs={[\\n  [6, 7],\\n  [7, 6],\\n  [7, 8],\\n  [8, 7],\\n  [7, 7],\\n  [0, 7],\\n  [7, 0],\\n  [7, 14],\\n  [14, 7],\\n]} />\\n\\n- \`*Q */ne [7] [7] (7) (7) (7) (7) (7)\`: There is again barely enough room to fit everything around the \`*Q\`, so the \`*Q\` has to go in the exact center and the other 8 blocks have to go on the corners and in the centers of the edges. \`*/ne\` has to go in the southwest corner.

So all three must be inverted by the \`![2]\`. But then they still need one block outside their pattern, so each must be either in a corner or right next to one. The only way for \`![2]\` to invert all of them is for \`![2]\` to be diagonally adjacent to a corner. We then need one block in the opposite corner, which can’t be \`*[8]\`, so it must be \`/s\`, which must be on either the southwest or southeast corner. From there, \`*[8]\` must be in the exact center. So there are exactly two solutions, depending on which corner \`/s\` is placed in.\\n\\n<BlocksPuzzleBoard blocks={\\"1(19) 1(19) 1(19) ![2] *[8] /s\\".split(\\" \\")} locs={[\\n  [0, 0],\\n  [0, 1],\\n  [1, 0],\\n  [1, 1],\\n  [7, 7],\\n  [14, 14],\\n]} />\\n\\nThe number of solutions in the three puzzles is 2, 21, and 2.

      "content": "To fill in this puzzle, we should put the given words into the circles so that we make a crossword clue along each of the paths from the central circle to the “leaves”. For example, in the solution picture farther below, two of the clues are:\\n- (start from the center, go up then left) Word for a group of Odyssean temptresses (6)\\n-\\t(start from the center, go down then right) Word which is an antonym of forte (5)\\n\\nThe process of actually doing this is a mixture of putting together reasonable clues (“Odyssean temptresses” goes together), guessing their answers (SIRENS), and carefully placing the words so that we can make every word fit (SIRENS must end at a circle containing (6)). The puzzle has a checker which we should take full advantage of to confirm correct intermediate answers.\\n\\nOnce all of the clues are completed, it’s time to use the squiggly lines and swooshes around some of the circles. These symbols suggest that we can combine the answers at neighboring leaves. It turns out that the neighbors for a squiggly line make a short clue when read together which can be resolved into a new answer (these answers can also be confirmed with the checker):\\n-\\tSWEET FLOWER PRODUCT ⇒ NECTAR\\n-\\tINITIAL CLONE ⇒ DOLLY\\n-\\tPIANO FIXER ⇒ TUNER\\n\\nThe swooshes are a bit trickier to identify; they should be interpreted as phonetically combining the first half of one adjacent word with the second half of the other adjacent word.\\n-\\tSIRENS ALLIANCE ⇒ SCIENCE\\n-\\tEMAIL NOVEL ⇒ EVIL\\n\\nContinuing the process back to the central circle, the final answer is the phonetic combination of BOWTIE and TELLER into <Answer />.

      "content": "Experimenting with the BASE farm, we infer that new words are added to the farm by connecting to the existing word with the closest semantic similarity. Constructing a farm with the topology shown in the target diagram solves the farm and unlocks more farms.\\n\\nSolving subsequent farms unlocks adjacent farms, as well as reveals yellow connecting lines in the map display. A subset of patches in each solved farm is also highlighted as \\"productive\\". We may infer that the highlighted subset of patches all share a common letter that is not present in the patches not highlighted. We extract this letter as the productive letter of each farm.\\n\\nSome strategies that are useful across farms:\\n\\n- The second patch always connects to the first patch. When constructing the first few patches, choose words that are as semantically different as possible.\\n- Avoid adding too many words with similar meanings when constructing the inner patches. For example, rather than adding PIG and CHICKEN to COW, we might prefer to add BEEF and FARM instead. This gives us more control over where future patches get added.\\n- We may use variations of the same word to complete the outer patches. For example, we may add WALKED, WALKS, and WALKING to WALK. Of course, using this trick can make the farm a little less interesting, so we avoided using it in the example farms below.\\n- The algorithm often considers word function a stronger indicator of semantic similarity than conceptual similarity. For example, when given the choice between CELLO or PIANIST, the algorithm prefers to connect CELLIST to PIANIST rather than CELLO. We may use this to our advantage by creating clusters of words with similar function.\\n\\nStrategies for individual farms:\\n\\n- ANIMALS, SPORTS, MUSIC: Be creative! There are more animal-related, sports-related and music-related words than just actual animals, sports and musical genres.\\n- STARS: Start with two words that are very different from each other. Choose generic words that have multiple meanings or are used in a variety of contexts.\\n- EXCLUSIVE: For the inner patches, avoid using words with the letter E, or words with many common letters. This gives us more freedom with the outer patches. It is also easier to rely on the exclusivity constraint to control the topology of the initial patches rather than worrying too much about semantic similarity.\\n- EDIT: Don’t worry too much about semantic similarity. Keep words about the same length for the inner patches, and vary word length more with the outer patches. Use a variety of different letters.\\n- CHAIN: Use a variety of different start and end letters to reduce the chances of patches from connecting to the middle of the chain.\\n- INITIALS: Choose a very common starting letter.\\n- SUBSTRING: Avoid common prefixes and suffixes. Use long words for the inner patches. Avoid reusing the same common substrings for different edges. Don’t worry about semantic similarity at all.\\n- ANAGRAMS: Avoid direct anagrams. Use short words with common letters for the inner patches, and longer words with rarer letters for the outer patches. Don’t worry about semantic similarity at all.\\n- KEYBOARD: Find a group of similar words and keep them for last. Build the rest with trial and error.\\n- SCRABBLE: This farm is intentionally small and relatively easy to complete with some trial and error. The challenge is that this farm’s productive letter has a scrabble score of 4, requiring us to think of words with a large scrabble score.\\n\\n<Table\\n\\theaders={[\\"Farm\\", \\"Example patches\\", \\"Productive letter\\"]}\\n\\tcells={[\\n\\t\\t[\\"BASE\\", \\"FISH, TOMATO, SEA, INSECT, SHARK, ATTACK, TORNADO, KILLER, RED, FRUIT, APPLE, BANANA, PEAR, PASTA, NOODLES, RICE, ITALY, PINK, ORANGE, BLOOD, BEACH, OCEAN, SAIL, GRASSHOPPER, BEE, PEST\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"SCRABBLE\\", \\"TRAINS, STRAIN, PORE, STRAIT, VAR, LAW, THE, WAR\\", \\"H\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"KEYBOARD\\", \\"POOP, QUEER, PEEP, POO, PEE, PIP, RIP, WOW\\", \\"E\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"ANAGRAMS\\", \\"STIR, SIR, STRIP, TRIES, SIT, RISK, RISE, FIRS, STRIKE, STRIDE, SATIRE, TINS, TICS, FITS, STIFF, RIPS, PRIEST, TIPS, STINT, STINK, SNIT, TICKS, CHITS, CITES, FISTS, FLITS\\", \\"N\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"STARS\\", \\"NIGHT, FISH, SASHIMI, SALMON, TROUT, COD, SALTWATER, POND, FROG, SCALES, GILLS, TAIL, ANGLERFISH, SEAFOOD, NET, SLEEP, DAY, SHADE, CREEPY, STARS, COOL, SUPPER, EVENING, TIME, LULLABY, MOONLIGHT, NOCTURNE, CLUB\\", \\"H\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"SPORTS\\", \\"BASKETBALL, TRIATHLON, RUNNING, SWIMMING, BICYCLE, UNICYCLE, RACE, CAR, SAILING, MOTORCYCLE, HURDLES, STADIUM, BADMINTON, SPEED, TEAMMATE, GOALIE, SHOOTER, PLAYER, HALL, FIELD, POOL, DIVING, ARENA, RACKET, TENNIS, PONG\\", \\"O\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"MUSIC\\", \\"BEETHOVEN, CONCERT, PIANO, SYMPHONY, MOZART, BACH, REQUIEM, AMADEUS, CONCERTO, OVERTURE, ORCHESTRAL, CLARINET, TUBA, CELLO, TROMBONE, KEYBOARDIST, DRUMMER, CELLIST, MIDI, MELODY, CHORD, HARMONY, SONG, PERFORMANCE, STAGE, RECITAL\\", \\"U\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"EDIT\\", \\"SPARE, PART, SHIRE, PORE, PARED, PATS, ARTY, CHART, POPES, FORK, POSH, HARD, LARD, BARD, SHINS, STILE, SHOE, HOPE, SHALE, SHOWER, SOL, STILL, BILE, GRINS, SPINE, SHINES\\", \\"S\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"INITIALS\\", \\"TIGER, TIRE, TURN, TICK, TRAIN, TRACK, TRIP, TWENTY, THREE, THIRTY, TEN, TRANSFORM, TWIST, TRAM, TRANSPORT, TACK, TOE, TICKLE, TACO, TREE, TABLE, TORTA, TORTILLA, THISTLE, TREEHOUSE, TRUNK\\", \\"E\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"CHAIN\\", \\"ACROBAT, PASTA, TACTIC, CATALOG, GNAW, WARM, MOLDY, YESTERDAY, YORE, EXECUTE, ENTERTAIN, NOISY, YELL, LOUD, DAMAGING, GUARANTOR, REGISTER, RECORD, DATA, ARITHMETIC, COUNT, TAXATION, NEMESIS, SNACK, KISS, SMOOCH, HUGGING, GIRTH, HAWAII, INDONESIA, ASIA, AZERBAIJAN, NEPAL, LAOS, SPAIN, NORDIC, CLAIM, MARX, XEROX, XYLOPHONE, ELEPHANT, TIGER, RHINO, OSTRICH, HERON, NEST, TURF, FIELD, DITCH\\", \\"F\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"SUBSTRING\\", \\"STELLAR, BELLIGERENT, ALARMIST, TELEGRAPH, STEPMOTHER, MISS, ARMS, GIST, HEROICS, SMOTHER, ANTITHESIS, GRADIENT, ELEGANCE, ENTRAPS, LIGATURE, GERRYMANDER, PERENNIAL, PERCH, DIAL, TENNER, RAIDER, FOREMAN, ERROR, GATE, LURE, TURN\\", \\"O\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"ANIMALS\\", \\"SALMON, HORSE, BEE, PIG, BOAR, HOG, PORK, EAGLE, SHARK, DONKEY, MULE, ASS, LLAMA, GOLDFISH, CATFISH, TILAPIA, TOADFISH, HOUSEFLY, LADYBUG, BUTTERFLY, DOLPHIN, STINGRAY, EEL, CONDOR, PELICAN, HAWK\\", \\"U\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"EXCLUSIVE\\", \\"JAZZ, COOK, COLD, MUSIC, TUBA, BURN, SONG, PASTA, HUMMED, LYRIC, YELL, ESSAY, TEXT, BARD, LULLABY, BAND, SHIVER, WINTER, FREEZE, VIOLIN, HORN, CELLO, FLAME, NOODLE, RICE, FLOUR\\", \\"R\\"],\\n\\t]}\\n/>\\n\\nThe yellow connecting lines in the map display form a path.

The direction of the color shift tells us whether the two Celestials, the Celestial speaking and the Celestial seen, become closer together or farther apart at each step. If the color moves towards red (i.e. redshift), the Celestials move further apart. If the color moves towards violet (i.e. blueshift), the Celestials move closer together. The absolute amount of shift (i.e. distance in ROYGBIV) tells us their relative speed, which the Kid suggests is important. Unless explicitly constrained by the dialogue, it is ambiguous which of the two Celestials is the one that moves at each step.\\n\\n<Table\\n\\theaders={[\\"Step number\\", \\"Who is speaking\\", \\"Who is seen\\", \\"Original letter\\", \\"Transformed letter\\", \\"Relative motion\\", \\"Speed\\", \\"Additional information from dialogue\\"]}\\n\\tcells={[\\n\\t\\t[\\"1\\", \\"B\\", \\"T\\", \\"V\\", \\"G\\", \\"farther\\", \\"3\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"2\\", \\"T\\", \\"O\\", \\"I\\", \\"O\\", \\"farther\\", \\"4\\", \\"This step's motion is along the same line as step 1's.\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"3\\", \\"T\\", \\"P\\", \\"G\\", \\"V\\", \\"closer\\", \\"3\\", \\"T moves in this step but not in any previous step.\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"4\\", \\"F\\", \\"O\\", \\"I\\", \\"Y\\", \\"farther\\", \\"3\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"5\\", \\"T\\", \\"R\\", \\"R\\", \\"B\\", \\"closer\\", \\"4\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"6\\", \\"O\\", \\"K\\", \\"B\\", \\"Y\\", \\"farther\\", \\"2\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"7\\", \\"F\\", \\"K\\", \\"B\\", \\"R\\", \\"farther\\", \\"4\\", \\"K moves onto F's location in step 6.\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"8\\", \\"F\\", \\"P\\", \\"G\\", \\"O\\", \\"farther\\", \\"2\\", \\"P and F start at the same location just before this step.\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"9\\", \\"P\\", \\"R\\", \\"I\\", \\"G\\", \\"farther\\", \\"2\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"10\\", \\"P\\", \\"T\\", \\"V\\", \\"R\\", \\"farther\\", \\"6\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"11\\", \\"R\\", \\"B\\", \\"B\\", \\"Y\\", \\"farther\\", \\"2\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"12\\", \\"B\\", \\"P\\", \\"R\\", \\"Y\\", \\"closer\\", \\"2\\", \\"B moves in this step.\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"13\\", \\"P\\", \\"B\\", \\"R\\", \\"G\\", \\"closer\\", \\"3\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"14\\", \\"P\\", \\"F\\", \\"O\\", \\"R\\", \\"farther\\", \\"1\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t\\t[\\"15\\", \\"O\\", \\"K\\", \\"B\\", \\"Y\\", \\"farther\\", \\"2\\", \\"\\"],\\n\\t]}\\n/>\\n\\nWe may now use this information to determine where everyone was and who moved at every step.

Emotes](https://hololive.wiki/wiki/Membership_Emotes)\\n\\nthere are a few quirks about these emotes i should explain..\\n\\nevery youtube channel with memberships enabled gives access to custom

prefix, which comes before every emote. the default prefix is just an underscore \`_\`. most holomems don’t have a prefix set, but some do. that’s why for example \`:_スバルすばるさいりうむ:\` has repeated names – the first bit is subaru’s emote prefix and the rest is her emote name!!\\n\\nnow this means that there are some ambiguities in what penlight an emote refers to, especially when lots of holomems use

Below, we describe a logical path to arrive at this solution.\\n\\nLet the seven numbers be A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, in order. Let their sum be S.\\n\\nWe can immediately get that E=1, F=7, C≤9, and D≤3. We also deduce from the identities of E and F that B≤4 and G≤5. Thus, S−A = B+C+D+E+F+G ≤ 4+9+3+1+7+5 = 29.\\n\\nA = ⌊A⌋ = S/7 implies that A = ⌊(S−A)/6⌋ ≤ ⌊29/6⌋ = 4, and so S ≤ 29+4 = 33. From F=7, we also know that S ≥ 1+1+1+1+1+7+1 = 13. Since S must be a multiple of 7 for A to be an integer, S can only be 14, 21 or 28.\\n\\nThis tells us that C is either 1 or 2, which lets us tighten our bound to S ≤ 4+4+2+3+1+7+5 = 26, limiting the possibilities for S to 14 or 21. 14 can be easily eliminated. If S=14, then A=2, leaving B+C+D+G = 14−(7+2+1) = 4. This fixes B=C=D=G=1, contradicting the definitions for B and G.\\n\\nThus, S=21, A=3, and C=2. We now have the numbers 3, B, 2, D, 1, 7, G. This tightens our bound for B to B≤3. In fact, B cannot be 3, since that would force D=G=3, contradicting the definition for D.\\n\\nWe can also eliminate B=2. If B=2, then the definition for B implies that either D or G must be 2. S=21 implies that the other of D or G must be 4. Either assignment contradicts the definition for D.\\n\\nThus, B=1, and so G≤5 and D+G = 7. We also know from before that D≤3, so D is either 2 or 3. If D=3, then G=4, contradicting the definition for D. This leaves us finally with D=2, G=5."

      "content": "A natural sign cancels a sharped or a flatted note. If the first note was sharp, then the second natural note is lower in pitch (i.e., X♯ to X♮). If the first note was flat, then the second note is higher in pitch (i.e., X♭ to X♮).\\n\\n**First ambiguity: clef.** The most common clefs are treble clef (the middle note is B) and bass clef (the note is D). Let’s come back to this.\\n\\n**Second ambiguity: key.** Suppose the first note has been modified earlier this bar by an accidental. The notes are then different in pitch. Is the accidental more likely a sharp or a flat?\\n\\nSuppose the first note has not been modified by an earlier accidental this bar. Suppose the key signature has no sharps or flats. Then the second note is the same pitch as the first note, and the natural is redundant. If the natural was a courtesy accidental (given as a reminder), it would more commonly appear in parentheses, and I can’t think of a reason not to give it for the first note (unless there was a bar line in between the two notes, resetting accidentals from the prior bar).\\n\\nBased on this, we eliminate the notes being the same pitch.\\n\\nNow consider the key, along with the two most likely candidate notes B and D.\\n\\nWhat key signatures have B sharped or flatted? As more sharps/flats are added to the key signature, the order in which notes are modified is:\\n\\n- sharp order: FCGDAE**B**\\n- flat order: **BEADGCF**\\n\\nWhat key signatures have D sharped or flatted?\\n\\n- sharp order: FCG**DAEB**\\n- flat order: BEA**DGCF**\\n\\nIf all keys (with up to seven flats or sharps) are equally likely, then D could just as likely be sharped or flatted, whereas B is flatted in 7/8 keys where it’s modified. This analysis suggests that the second note is slightly more likely to be higher than the first note.\\n\\nThis doesn’t affect our answer, but in reality, keys with fewer sharps and flats are more common, since on many instruments it’s more difficult to play, compounded by unfamiliarity with more uncommon keys. Rarely, keys may also have more than seven flats and sharps. We might also wish to consider other clefs. For example, if the staff has an alto clef, the note would be a C and be more likely to be sharp than flat following the above analysis.\\n\\nFurther discussion questions:\\n\\n- Instrumentation: What instrument is this score for? Is it a concert pitch instrument? Does that affect what clefs and key signatures are most likely? What if it’s a tenor part in SATB voice? What if it’s for alto saxophone? Could it be for non-pitched percussion?\\n- Stem direction: [Stems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_%28music%29) usually point down for notes on the middle line; why are the stems going upwards? Does that give you context about earlier notes, or perhaps multiple voices in the same staff? Is the music for a vocal line, with the stem oriented upwards to avoid collision with lyrics below the staff?\\n- Accidentals: As discussed earlier, is there a situation where the two notes could be the same pitch? What about if the first note is modified in the bar?\\n- Melodic/harmonic intent: Why is there (probably) an augmented unison between these two notes? Is it part of a chromatic progression? Is the music starting or finishing a modulation? Is one of the notes from a borrowed chord, and if so, which chord and which note?\\n- Modes: What modes are most likely? Major, minor, mixolydian?\\n- Tuning and xenharmony: Does the tuning and xenharmony affect the answer?\\n\\nThe analysis above is not intended to be dispositive; because this is an open-ended question, we used a rubric to grade responses out of 10.\\n\\n<AuthorsNotes>\\n<Image />\\n</AuthorsNotes>\\n\\n### Rubric\\n\\n<Puzzle144Rubric\\n\\theaders={[\\n\\t\\t\\"Start from 10 points.

The car must be parked inside the garage.\\n\\n*“Do you guys not have cars and garages to park them in?”*  \\n―Blizzard Entertainment Principal Game Designer, Wyatt Cheng\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn this solution, I will be explaining exactly what I do to Get Home! in one press. But first, we need to clear something up. Opening the garage door takes one button press on the remote. Dragging the car into the garage takes one press on the car. So you might think you’d need at least two presses to Get Home!. But when you do that, the game taunts you and tells you to do better. Can we do better? Strangely, the press count goes up by a half each time you press and unpress. \\n\\nNow hold on, I know what you’re thinking. “A press is a press. You can’t say it’s only a half.” Well, TJ “<TeamDisplayNameDisplay noLink={true} hideAdminLinks={true} />” Yoshi, hear me out. A press actually has three parts to it. When pressed, when held, and when released. And together, this forms one complete press. Now usually, it’s the pressing that’s useful. Because that’s the only part that makes the satisfying “blip” sound on the remote’s button, or start driving the car with a cheerful “Yoshi!”. However, sometimes we just like the holding part, which makes the “brrprhrhprhrbrhprhpr” sound as you drag the car. And as for the release, well, the remote only sends a “doo-loo-loo” signal to open the garage with a resounding “gonk” when we release the button.\\n\\nTo Get home!, you need to press the remote and release it, and then press the car and hold it into the garage. So, how many presses is that total? Well, it appears to be two, and if we were solving this puzzle in isolation, then yeah, it would be two. But, in a full puzzlehunt press challenge run, there are other presses that occur earlier in the run, such as the press needed to wish for this puzzle and the press needed to open this puzzle and the press needed to select the title text of the puzzle to copy into your Discord to say, “Wow, check out this new puzzle we unlocked, Get home!! Pay no attention to the fact that this action is not at all necessary in my full puzzlehunt press challenge run, which I am currently attempting!” So if we take those presses into consideration as well, then how many presses would it take? The naïve answer would be five. Two to enter the puzzle, one to select the title of the puzzle, and two within the puzzle that we established earlier. \\n\\nHowever, we can do better. We can actually do it in four by simply holding out the third press used to select the title of the puzzle to be used for the half press in the game. Because the remote only requires the button to be released, not actually pressed. So in this fashion, Get Home! only adds on an additional one press to the run since the first press just leeches off a previous press. So, to capture this phenomenon, we call it 1.5 presses. On a single star basis, you’d round that up to two. But in a full hunt run, you’d round it down to one. So, in conclusion, since that first press counts in some context but adds no additional presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a half press. \\n\\nSo, going back to the solution, you can see that I start with the mouse button already held outside of the game’s window. And so in the full hunt run, this press will just leech off of a previous one. And so it won’t incur an additional press. Okay, glad that’s explained. Now, what am I doing in the game? Here, I’m using a trick called Remote Code Execution. You see, if I move my pointer to the remote while held, and then release the click, the remote still opens the garage. But I only used half a press in the game. Now, we need to move the pointer to the car, press and hold, and drag the car to the garage. But if I release the button, then that would count as a half remote press and a full car press, for 1.5 presses in game. As for releasing the car, well, you don’t actually need to do that to Get home!. We might want to use the held press outside of the game in a full puzzlehunt press challenge run. That way, we only use a half press on the remote and a half press on the car, for a total of one press.\\n\\nNow, while we’re holding the car on the end screen with only one press in-game, we can read off part of the answer. But the answer is covered up by the car, so we need to move the car around to be able to read it. Anyway, now it’s time to build up some speed. And I mean, a lot of speed. So to get that speed, we’re going to use a trick called Hyper Speed Driving and here’s how it works. \\n\\nYou probably already know that moving the car is as fast as moving your mouse. But if I move my mouse really fast, by shaking it back and forth, a bug in your brain’s code called Persistence of Vision allows you to read the answer. You see, even though part of the answer text is obscured by the car, the memory addresses in your optical cortex cause afterimages of the text to persist in your vision. When I move the car fast enough, the entire answer text in full can be read out at one time, to someone else in the Discord call to type out into the answer submission box. Obviously, I can’t type the answer, because I would lose control of the car and also that would require a new click, causing the answer to disappear. While my teammate is doing this, I’m building up speed by oscillating my wrists over time, creating a feedback loop that lets me build up as much speed as I want.\\n\\nNow, you’re probably wondering what I’m going to need all this speed for. After all, I do build up speed for twelve hours. But to answer that, we need to talk about parallel universes.\\n\\nOkay, so while I was solving this puzzle on my computer, one of my teammates actually was on the bus back home to their garage-less apartment and looking at this puzzle on their phone. But they’re not a homeowner, so how could they possibly Get Home!? That teammate’s name? *Albert Einstein*.\\n\\nJust kidding, that teammate was actually me. See, in a parallel universe, I take the bus home and solve puzzles on my phone, which (unlike homes) everyone definitely owns. And Albert Einstein owned a home instead. On 112 Mercer Street, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA. Did you know United States of Americans never put their country name on their address? But Albert Einstein was born in the German Empire, so he knew better. So this imaginary world is what we call a parallel universe, or a PU.\\n\\nAnyways, in this PU, I’m doing a full puzzlehunt press challenge run on my phone instead of my computer, so I’m using a touchscreen instead of a mouse. Now, if I beat the game normally with two presses, I can test how presses are being detected on the end screen. Unfortunately, Remote Code Execution does not work on mobile, because presses are detected even outside of the game window! So is this route (Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2024 / Category Extensions / Press Challenge / Individual Stars / Get home! / 1x presses / Platform: Mobile) just impossible? Well no, because in 1905 Albert Einstein published a new trick called *Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt* (*On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light*). \\n\\nYou see, the remote sends signals to the garage using light in the radio frequency. However, since phones are smaller than monitors, it’s easy for your finger to slip on the remote and not release right on top of the button. By simply pressing and holding on the remote, and then slipping out of the remote without lifting my finger, I cause the remote to release a discrete quanta of luminous energy, opening the garage door in only half a press. For simplicity, we call this Quanta in the Parallel Universe one QPU. Thanks Albert!\\n\\nNow, if we wanna move one QPU and Get Home!, it’s not sufficient to have QPU speed. We need QPU De Facto speed, so now comes the matter of driving the car. But first, watch this video: \\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"513\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sn5g3KfJcRU\\" title=\\"DIABLO IMMORTAL on world&#39;s smallest smartphone?! #shorts\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nSee, in Diablo Immortal, you can move your character with one finger while spamming abilities with your other finger. That trick carries over here. Who says we can’t operate a motor vehicle while using a hand-held electronic device while on the phone while on the bus??? So in general, any multiple of the fingers will cover multiple QPU at once. In other words, while holding my remote half press finger, I start another half press with a second finger to move the car into the now open garage. \\n\\nNow we’ve won, but we can’t let go of either of our fingers, or the answer will vanish just like your attention after reading this far. We’ll use Hyper Speed Driving again. Since I’m already in a Discord call with my mates, I yell to them the answer while madly twirling my thumbs on my screen. Everyone on the crowded bus turns to look at me. I miss my stop. I press the REQUEST STOP button, get off, and walk an extra five kilometers home.\\n\\nAnd there you have it, Get Home! done in one press.

This refers to titin, a protein whose full name is extremely long. We can look up the full 189,819-letter name for titin at [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Protologisms/Long_words/Titin). Doing the indexing, which is easiest with a computer program, gives the cluephrase OTHER NAME PLUS G. Another name for titin is connectin; adding a g to the end gives <Answer />.\\n\\n<AuthorsNotes>\\n\\nWhile factchecking this puzzle, Brian discovered that one of the oft-cited systematic names for titin, which had been copy-pasted across dozens of websites, was incorrect. It wasn't even a valid systematic name for any peptide: although it mostly corresponded to a (strangely repetitive) sequence of amino acids, it also regularly included the substrings “acetyl” and “titin”. Most damningly, it had an X (right before the end of the name: “serxisoleucine”), which the systematic name of a peptide could not have.\\n\\nLater, we found out that even the name on Wiktionary was incorrect after writing our own program and checking against that. The only correct source we found was on [Sarah McCulloch's website](https://www.sarahmcculloch.com/luminary-uprise/2009/longest-word/), though it felt strange referencing that in the puzzle, so we stuck to the original source used to construct it.\\n\\nBoth the completely wrong name with an X and the Wiktionary name have exactly 189,819 letters, a widely reported fact about the name of titin even on websites that don’t reprint the whole thing. Sarah McCulloch's website repeats this claim, but the full name on that page (which we believe to be correct) actually has 241,578 letters, making it a whopping 27% longer. We’re not sure how the number 189,819 came to be. (You can get a name very similar to the Wiktionary name by using the shorter “Small cardiac N2-B” isoform of titin, but we still found a few dozen differences between the amino acid sequence implied by Wiktionary’s name and the sequence we found online. We think that that shorter isoform’s name has 189,766 letters.)\\n\\nWe considered writing a “Don’t Google It 3” puzzle that asked for the systematic name of titin, but didn't have enough time to fully implement and testsolve it. (It was also less funny given that there *is* a source out there that gets it right.)\\n\\n</AuthorsNotes>"

      "content": "Let’s go through the script and determine what each statement reveals about the media and each character. The [Fictional Crossover Wiki](https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com) will come in handy throughout.\\n\\n### Albert’s Character\\n\\n*Albert: I don’t know whether Leatherface appears in this piece of media.*\\n\\nThis indicates Leatherface appears in at least one piece of media that Albert’s character (whom we’ll call A) appears in, but not all of them. Leatherface does not have that many crossover appearances, so this narrows it down a fair bit—see [the wiki page](https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/Texas_Chainsaw_Massacre).\\n\\n*Cheryl: Just to clarify, both your characters were in this piece of media when it was first released, and not added later.*  \\n*Albert: That narrows it down, but I still don’t know if that fictional character is in it.*  \\n\\nLooking at the list of crossovers from the link above, and making sure to consider only Type 1 crossovers, we can now eliminate everything except the Jason vs. Leatherface crossover comic, as all other appearances are in either video game DLC or TV spots. Technically, at this point, A could still be any character from Jason vs. Leatherface, such as The Hitchhiker, Pamela Voorhees, etc., but from context we can be fairly confident that A is **JASON VOORHEES**. This will be further confirmed below.\\n\\n### The Media\\n\\n*Bernard: Does that mean the media is not a single episode of a TV show, then?*  \\n*Cheryl: That’s correct.*  \\n*Bernard: I still don’t know what the media is, but thanks to this clarification I do know the Iron Giant appears as a character in it.*  \\n\\nFrom this, we know that Bernard’s character B has the property that all of B’s crossover appearances that are <strong style={{color: \\"inherit\\", textShadow: \\"none\\"}}>not</strong> television episodes, of which there are at least two, include the Iron Giant. (We only need to consider crossover media because while Bernard doesn’t know who A is, he does know that A appears in at least three different pieces of fictional media, meaning the media cannot be a standalone property, such as the 2015 comedy film *Trainwreck*.) The [Iron Giant](https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/The_Iron_Giant) appears in three pieces of crossover media: *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, *MultiVersus*, and a one-off *Teen Titans Go!* anniversary episode, the last of which is disqualified by the last clarification.\\n\\n*Albert: I now know what the piece of media is, and I can tell you that Austin Powers is not in it.*  \\n*Bernard: I also know what the piece of media is.*  \\n\\nFor some reason, Austin Powers appears in *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, so we can rule that out. If you identified Jason Voorhees earlier, you can also use the same logic as Albert did by noting that Jason does not appear in *Space Jam: A New Legacy*. This means the media must be **MULTIVERSUS**.\\n\\nAside: The Iron Giant and Jason Voorhees both appear as avatars in *Ready Player One* (2018). We aren’t counting these as appearances of the characters, as they function more like costumes within the universe of the film—it’d be like saying the character Yoda is in *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*.\\n\\n### Bernard’s Character\\n\\nAs stated above, we know that all of B’s non-TV crossover appearances, of which there are at least two, include the Iron Giant. This means that B must appear in *Space Jam: A New Legacy* and *MultiVersus* <strong style={{color: \\"inherit\\", textShadow: \\"none\\"}}>and no other crossover media</strong>.\\n\\nAmong the roster of *[MultiVersus](https://multiversus.com/en-ca/roster)*, which is thankfully not too large, most of the characters are from popular franchises with many crossover appearances, and a few are baffling picks that cross over only in *MultiVersus* (the Banana Guard from *Adventure Time*, Arya Stark from *Game of Thrones*, the exclusive character Reindog). The only remaining options are Stripe (from *Gremlins*) and LeBron James (from *Trainwreck*), who both appear in *Space Jam: A New Legacy*. (Stripe also has a brief cameo in *Ready Player One* that is not currently listed on the wiki.)\\n\\nBetween these two, we know from Bernard’s first clarification that the character must have at least one TV show appearance. This is true of [LeBron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James#Filmography) but not Stripe, which means that character B must be **LEBRON JAMES**.\\n\\n<AuthorsNotes>\\nThis puzzle was inspired by the 2021 Mystery Hunt puzzle *[Ignorance](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2021/puzzle/ignorance/)*, as well as the extremely bizarre roster of *MultiVersus*. This puzzle is much less tightly constructed than those in *Ignorance*, due to the messy nature of the real-world data, so apologies if any solvers got sidetracked by ambiguities or red herrings.\\n\\nThe Fictional Crossover wiki is very fun! Did you know that Shrek is a playable character in the 2009 racing game tie-in *Madagascar Kartz*? Me neither!\\n\\nYou may be tempted to argue that as of the publication of this puzzle, some of the clues are no longer valid, as for example the Iron Giant now appears in this puzzle alongside Leatherface. While this is an amusing idea, I think it is fairly clear that the only <strong style={{color: \\"inherit\\", textShadow: \\"none\\"}}>characters</strong> that appear in *The Most Ambitious Crossover in the History of Cheryl’s Birthday Riddles* are Albert, Bernard, and Cheryl, and the other entities are only mentioned by name (and are therefore only Type 2 crossovers by the Wiki’s definition).\\n\\nI didn’t realize that Stripe fit the “only crosses over in SJ:ANL and MV” criterion until I started writing this solution, and was quite surprised to discover this in the process of fact-checking. Thankfully, this fact should not significantly impact the solving process (unless it did, in which case whoops). Bernard going to the bathroom was added to prevent him from deducing that the media had to be *MultiVersus* due to Jason Voorhees not being in *Space Jam*. I also had to add the word “fictional” to Albert’s sentence “That narrows it down, but I still don't know if that fictional character is in it” because it turns out that NFL player Tony Romo appears in both *Trainwreck* and the 2022 Paramount+ film / Madden NFL advertisement *Fantasy Football*.\\n</AuthorsNotes>"

These obsidian blocks may be casted in place by pouring water over lava, obviating the need for a diamond pickaxe. The only way for us to get lava is by trading wool for lava buckets, and the only way for us to get wool is by trading golden pickaxes for wool. However, trading in our golden pickaxe directly only nets us 9 lava.\\n\\nTo get more lava, we need to produce more golden pickaxes, which we can only get by crafting from gold smelted from ore received from the villager in exchange for stone blocks, which means that we need cobblestone to build a furnace to smelt more cobblestone in. In total, we would need 8 cobblestone to build a furnace and 9 more cobblestone to smelt and trade for 3 gold ore in order to craft a single golden pickaxe. It is not possible to acquire this much cobblestone from trades alone.\\n\\nInstead, we must rely mainly on pouring lava on water to cast cobblestone. We can’t actually acquire such cobblestone into our inventory, however, unless we mine it with a pickaxe. Besides golden pickaxes, the only other kinds of pickaxes we can obtain are stone pickaxes, which we can craft from sticks and cobblestone.\\n\\nSince all we can do to start is trade in our golden pickaxe, we must rely on trades to bootstrap our first cobblestone. Already, this presents a problem. In order to craft a stone pickaxe, we need 3 cobblestone. However, the 9 wool we start with can only be traded for 9 buckets of lava. If we empty all the buckets and use the 1st and 6th trades to acquire 3 cobblestone, we won’t have any buckets left to pick up lava with, and then we can’t get the sticks we need to craft the pickaxe.\\n\\nTo get around this, we instead only use the first trade twice to get 2 buckets of water, then empty them onto the ground on diagonally adjacent squares. This creates an infinite water source, which allows us to pick up as much water as we want. Note that lava does not also behave this way in Minecraft, meaning that our lava will always be limited by what we can get from trades. Using our five remaining buckets, we may now pick up 2 lava and 3 water to trade in for the materials needed to craft our first stone pickaxe.\\n\\nWith our stone pickaxe, we may now acquire plenty of cobblestone. However, we still cannot smelt cobblestone into stone, because we lack a fuel source. Lava buckets may be used as a fuel source, but we lack buckets to pick up lava with. The only way we can acquire more buckets is by trading in 127 cobblestone.\\n\\nUnfortunately, stone pickaxes have a limited durability, and can only mine up to 131 blocks before breaking. Note that this durability value is different between the Java and Bedrock editions. If we use up the entire durability of the stone pickaxe to mine cobblestone and trade in 127 cobblestone for 2 buckets, we would only have 4 cobblestone left over, which is not enough to build a furnace with.\\n\\nInstead, we fill the two new buckets with lava and trade them in for sticks to build a new stone pickaxe. This puts us back to having a stone pickaxe and lava, but no buckets to make a fuel source with. The only difference is that we now have a bit more cobblestone and a little less lava. The solution, then, is to repeat the entire cycle of mining cobblestone, trading for sticks and crafting stone pickaxes to effectively convert lava into cobblestone until we have enough to build the furnace and smelt stone.\\n\\nIf we just do as above, however, we would find that we don’t have enough lava to get the cobblestone we need. There is just one last game mechanic we must use, and that is tool repair. Combining two used stone pickaxes produces a new stone pickaxe with up to 6 additional points of durability, on top of the sum of the durability of the two original pickaxes. This lets us accumulate enough cobblestone to get our first new golden pickaxe after just two additional cycles of mining and crafting.\\n\\nUp to this point, our options have been very limited, and our actions were essentially forced. In fact, we now find ourselves with just a golden pickaxe, a stone pickaxe with a single point of durability, and no mined cobblestone or placed lava to spare. That means, once again, that we need to craft a second golden pickaxe to get our 10th lava.\\n\\nFortunately, crafting the second golden pickaxe is much easier than the first, as trading in our current golden pickaxe leaves us with a wealth of buckets. We just need to do so with as few trades as possible. As we no longer need to scrimp on pickaxe durability, we spend the last point of durability on our stone pickaxe on one cobblestone, reducing the number of trades needed to craft a new stone pickaxe. This lets us mine the 9 cobblestone needed to get the gold for the second golden pickaxe.\\n\\nFinally, we construct the nether portal. In order to light the nether portal, we use lava to light one of our remaining wool on fire. If this wool is next to the nether portal when it’s complete, the fire would light the portal. In one last act of parsimony, rather than trade for an extra lava, we instead use our last lava to light the wool just before casting the lava into obsidian for the portal. With that, the portal activates, and we may finally escape to hell.\\n\\n<Table\\n  cells={[\\n    [\\"Trade\\", \\"Number of uses\\", \\"Shift\\", \\"Letter\\"],\\n    [\\"A\\", \\"2\\", \\"+14\\", \\"P\\"],\\n    [\\"B\\", \\"3\\", \\"+15\\", \\"R\\"],\\n    [\\"C\\", \\"3\\", \\"+12\\", \\"O\\"],\\n    [\\"D\\", \\"12\\", \\"+16\\", \\"B\\"],\\n    [\\"E\\", \\"6\\", \\"+6\\", \\"L\\"],\\n    [\\"F\\", \\"5\\", \\"0\\", \\"E\\"],\\n    [\\"G\\", \\"23\\", \\"+16\\", \\"M\\"],\\n  ]}\\n/>\\n\\nApplying the provided shifts to the number of times each trade was used, and using A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26, gives the answer, <Answer />."

Push the line of three blue boxes below all the way to the right. Hit \\"X\\" at the save point to save. Push the L-shape 4 cells to the right, just enough to unblock the upper corridor. Move onto the exposed blue floor tile and hit \\"X\\" to restore. Move through the upper corridor and into the goal.\\n- Coin Counter: Take a right at the fork. Collect all the coins by first collecting the four in the right column, then the middle one, then the remaining top-right one (worth 5). Go back down to take the left passage to the exit at the top right, collecting the last coin along the way.\\n- Snakeoban: Move down once, right thrice, up once, left once, up once, left four times, down twice, right four times, down twice, then left four times to consume all the apples.\\n- Enigmash: Staying within the green area, move around to the left edge and enter the pink area. Move right to enter the blue area, with gravity pointing to the right. Move all the way down to push the bottom-left L-shape into the corner and exit into the green area. Re-enter the blue area through the gap on the right to push the bottom-right L-shape all the way to the left. Move up, then left to exit through the pink area into the green area. Staying within the green area, move around all the way to the top edge. Enter the blue area, pushing the top-left L-shape down. The left half of that L-shape turns into boulders as they enter the pink area, but the L-shapes on the bottom-left prevent them from falling further. Move left to the exit.\\n\\nUpon solving each level, the blocks in Savior, the dark blue floor tiles in Coin Counter, the snake in Snakeoban, and the blocks and boulders in Enigmash respectively form numbers. Indexing the numbers into the titles of the source games gives the answer, <Answer />."

      "content": "This puzzle is about several Masyu variants. Each puzzle can be solved using normal Masyu rules to a certain extent. From there, it’s possible to make educated guesses as to the rules, using the descriptions of the minerals. Video walkthroughs are available below. In particular:\\n\\n1. We can see that some circles have the path go into all 4 adjacent cells, and other circles do not have the path touch any of the 4 adjacent cells. This corresponds to hematite, which can either attract or repel the path: The path either goes through *all* the orthogonally adjacent cells, or *none* of them. Because hematite is described as hard, the path never goes through any dashed circles.\\n2. We can see that the path travels through some circles, and that the segments after those circles are shorter than the segments going into the circles. This corresponds to uraninite, which has a half-life: If the path goes through a dashed circle, then the length of the segment of the path going *into* that circle is twice the length of the segment of the path going *out of* that circle.\\n3. We can see that all circles that are on the path are part of long straight segments. This corresponds to black ice, which is slippery: If the path goes through a dashed circle, then it travels straight through (i.e. doesn't turn) that circle and the cells immediately before and after it.\\n4. We can see that the path crosses itself on one of the circles. This corresponds to gypsum, which is twinned: If the path goes through a dashed circle, it goes through that circle a second time.\\n\\nAfter solving each puzzle, drawing a line through the dashed circles used by the path draws a digit: 6, 2, 6, and 4, respectively. (In most cases, a dashed circle is \\"used\\" if the path goes through it; for hematite a dashed circle is \\"used\\" if the path touches it. Note that we do have to use most of the dashed circles to solve the puzzles.) Indexing the digit into the name of the mineral gives the answer <Answer />.\\n\\n## Video solutions\\n\\nPuzzle 1\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqiNZ-q68c0\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\nPuzzle 2\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGt57lMaIUQ\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\nPuzzle 3\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fNH9COlq94\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\nPuzzle 4\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHGKPTtxvoM\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\n<AuthorsNotes>\\nRock Lobster is solely played for morale reasons.\\n</AuthorsNotes>"

      "content": "<div lang=\\"zh\\">\\nThe title and flavortext of this puzzle reference the Chinese poem [Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den) by Yuan Ren Chao, which contains 92 characters all pronounced with the syllable Shi but differing in tone, as there are 4 tones in Mandarin Chinese. The punctuation characters used in the puzzle are also Chinese punctuation. We are given sentences followed by question marks and enumerations, and the enumerations sum to 92, suggesting that we should translate the sentences into a poem of 92 Chinese characters with some relation to Lion-Eating Poet.\\n\\nThe first sentence can be translated as follows:\\n\\nThe Tatars greatly build, greatly build, greatly greatly build, and Big Darmstadtium replies with the sound of clattering hooves.  \\n鞑大搭，大搭，大大搭，大𫟼答哒。  \\nDá dà dā dà dā dà dà dā dà dá dá dā\\n\\nAnd the first sentence in Lion-Eating Poet is as follows:\\n\\nIn a stone den was a poet called Shi Shi, who was a lion addict and had resolved to eat ten lions.  \\n石室诗士施氏，嗜狮，誓食十狮。  \\nShí shì shī shì shī shì shì shī shì shí shí shī\\n\\nThe sentence lengths in Lion-Eating Poet and the new poem match up perfectly. The tones also match up almost perfectly, except for places where 十 (ten) appears in Lion-Eating Poet, where the tones sometimes differ. This suggests that 十 is special in some way, which we will utilize later. The number of question marks is the number of distinct syllables in the sentence, for example the first sentence only uses Da, and the second sentence uses a mix of Da and An. Characters sharing the same syllable appear contiguously, which helps us narrow where syllable changes occur.\\n\\nFortunately, translation is doable without knowledge of Chinese, aided by online tools as well as identical word order before and after translation. One strategy for identifying the syllables is to paste the sentences into Google Translate, hit the reverse button, and hit the speaker button. Google Translate won’t give an ideal translation with only Da, but it will give a translation with suspiciously many Da’s. Other useful resources include [MDBG](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) and [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/), both of which accept queries like “da2” to mean “dá”, or “da” with the 2nd tone. On the flip side, even for native speakers, some of the characters may prove obscure like 啽, though none of the obscure characters are essential to the puzzle.\\n\\nBelow is the full poem with annotated translation.\\n\\nThe Tatars greatly build, greatly build, greatly greatly build, and Big Darmstadtium replies with the sound of clattering hooves.  \\n鞑大搭，大搭，大大搭,大𫟼答哒。  \\n鞑 (Tatars) 大 (big, greatly) 搭 (to build)，大 (big, greatly) 搭 (to build)，大 大 搭, 大 𫟼 (Darmstadtium) 答 (to reply) 哒 (clattering hooves onomatopoeia)  \\nDá dà dā, dà dā, dà dà dā, dà dá dá dā\\n\\nBig Darmstadtium reaches legal case, according to coastal safety.  \\n大𫟼达案，按岸安。  \\n大 (big, greatly) 𫟼 (Darmstadtium) 达 (to reach) 案 (case (as in legal))，按 (according to) 岸 (coast) 安 (safety)  \\nDà dá dá àn, àn àn ān\\n\\nThe legal case says (Cantonese): a dark latent thousand was owed by euryale ferox.  \\n案啽：暗潜千欠芡。  \\n案 (case (as in legal)) 啽 (to speak (Cantonese, obscure))：暗 (dark) 潜 (latent) 千 (thousand) 欠 (to owe) 芡 (Gorgon plant, euryale ferox)  \\nÀn án: àn qián qiān qiàn qiàn\\n\\nEuryale ferox before, owed a thousand handkerchiefs, and sleeping taxes.  \\n芡前，欠千帨,睡税。  \\n芡 (Gorgon plant, euryale ferox) 前 (before)，欠 (to owe) 千 (thousand) 帨 (handkerchief), 睡 (to sleep) 税 (tax)  \\nQiàn qián, qiàn qiān shuì, shuì shuì\\n\\nSleeping taxes and sleeping water are connected to mustard sister, and mustard sister borrows a street to expose the mustard commandments.  \\n睡税睡水接芥姐,芥姐借街揭芥诫。  \\n睡 (to sleep) 税 (tax) 睡 (to sleep) 水 (water) 接 (to catch, to connect) 芥 (mustard) 姐 (sister), 芥 (mustard) 姐 (sister) 借 (to borrow) 街 (street) 揭 (to expose) 芥 诫 (commandment)  \\nShuì shuì shuì shuǐ jiē jiè jiě, jiè jiě jiè jiē jiē jiè jiè\\n\\nScabies knot paragraph briefly carries, the extremity judges the head thoroughly.  \\n疥结段短端，端断头透。  \\n疥 (scabies) 结 (knot) 段 (paragraph, section) 短 (brief, short) 端 (end, extremity, to carry)，端 (end, extremity, to carry) 断 (to break, to judge) 头 (head) 透 (thoroughly, to penetrate)  \\nJiè jié duàn duǎn duān, duān duàn tóu tòu\\n\\nThe plank penetrating thief penetrates the wine flagon, thoroughly penetrating unit of livestock after unit of livestock.  \\n牏透偷透钭，透透头头。  \\n牏 (plank (obscure)) 透 (see-through, thoroughly, to penetrate) 偷 (to steal, thief) 透 (see-through, thoroughly, to penetrate) 钭 (wine flagon (obscure))，透 透 头 (head, measure word for livestock) 头 (head, measure word for livestock)  \\nTóu tòu tōu tòu tǒu, tòu tòu tóu tóu\\n\\nThe dice are transparent, thoroughly transparent, and the yellow transparent head thoroughly throws out the thief.  \\n骰透，透透，黈透头透投偷。  \\n骰 (dice) 透 (see-through, thoroughly, to penetrate)，透 (see-through, thoroughly, to penetrate) 透，黈 (yellow) 透 头 (head) 透 投 (to throw) 偷 (to steal, thief)  \\nTóu tòu, tòu tòu, tǒu tòu tóu tòu tóu tōu\\n\\nDice throwing yellow head is self funded, consults herewith Vanadium, fights against vexation to turn over the banner.  \\n骰投黈头自资，咨兹钒，反烦翻幡。  \\n骰 (dice) 投 (to throw) 黈 (yellow) 头 (head) 自 (self) 资 (funding, capital)，咨 (to consult) 兹 (herewith) 钒 (Vanadium)，反 (anti, to oppose, opposite) 烦 (to vex, vexation) 翻 (to turn over, to translate) 幡 (banner)  \\nTóu tóu tǒu tóu zì zī, zī zī fán, fǎn fán fān fān\\n\\nMeal infringes upon the farm range.  \\n饭犯畈范。  \\n饭 (meal) 犯 (to infringe, to violate) 畈 (farm) 范 (limits, range)  \\nFàn fàn fàn fàn\\n\\nAs hinted by the flavortext and the numbers at the bottom, 十 (ten) which resembles X is used to mark the spot.
