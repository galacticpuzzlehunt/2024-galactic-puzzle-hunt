  "submissionText": "This is a tree located on Wenshao Road in Zibo, Shandong, where the famous philosopher Confucius once lived. The tree is 3,000 years old. It is said that Confucius once leaned against this tree to listen to the music of Qi State, which is called \"Kongzi Wenshao\"（孔子闻韶） in Chinese. Confucius listened to the music of Qi State under this tree, and the music was so good that Confucius did not like meat for three months (三月不知肉味).",
