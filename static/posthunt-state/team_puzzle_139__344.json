  "submissionText": "This is a persimmon tree I planted this spring. Persimmon trees play a strong part in the Abrahamic religions as the tree of knowledge in the book of Genesis. In English, the origin of the name Persimmon actually comes from the phrase \"Per Simon\", meaning \"according to Simon\" where Simon is The Knower of all Things (hence the tree of knowledge). The name Simon comes from root words meaning \"hearing\" or \"listening\" (this is how you become smart.) This also correlates with the phrase Simon Says (and so it is done, as Simon Commands the Truth) or Seymour Simon, the author of timeless compendiums such as Volcanos, and Sharks. Many doubt this fact until they eat a persimmon, only to instantly make their \"thinking face\" immediately afterwards. Persimmons grow naturally in many areas, including Iowa, USA. If this one plays it smart, it might survive the winter.",
