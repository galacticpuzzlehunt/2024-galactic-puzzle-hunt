  "submissionText": "This tree was planted on the day I was born  and has survived three hurricanes, including one which ripped the roof off the house across the road from us. A few weeks ago, we found out it had a fungal infection and made the decision on Monday that we had to chop it down. The tree surgeons are coming tomorrow to remove it. This is the last photo we'll have together.",
