  "submissionText": "I am a cat. I am new to hugging - please excuse my technique.\n\nFun fact about this tree. It houses many birds - my favorite thing to meow at through Window TV.\nAnother fun fact about this tree. It is not a dogwood tree. \nAnother fun fact. I thought my human was the tallest thing in the world. This tree, though, is in fact taller than him.\n\nAfter hugging this tree, I have decided to be more eco friendly. I will no longer fly in my private jet. I can manage on commercial (in first class).",
