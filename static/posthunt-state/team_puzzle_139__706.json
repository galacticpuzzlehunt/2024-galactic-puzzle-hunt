  "submissionText": "Instead of one fun fact, here are are two semi-fun facts and a comment (which should together give enough info for solvers seeing this post-hunt to ID the tree):\n- This tree is the only one on its block (at least, on the south side of the street) to have no small fence blocking it. Convenient!\n- I believe there used to be a sign ten feet from this tree saying that on this site in 1897, nothing happened, but the sign's been gone for a few years. Now the opposite building is probably the least interesting on the block, sandwiched between a club and museum (not to mention the consulate a bit away on the north side of the street). \n\nA few blocks away, 9 years and several weeks ago, there was an NYT article about a different tree falling a few blocks away, which I remember because I was there. (Well, close enough to hear it, far enough not to be at risk.) I considered photographing that one, but it's 10:30 PM and also I don't want to tempt fate by having the most ironic thing happen.",
