  "submissionText": "The lichen that surrounds this tree is actually older than the tree itself. The back of the tree has a different species of lichen, and the two colonies have been in a bitter war since the dawn of time. This tree, sensing the dispute, grew itself between the two colonies, allowing peace to be made. The lichen gods were so pleased with the tree for solving their troubles that they decided the light would forever shine on the tree.",
