  "submissionText": "In the early hours of May 28, 2024, the Dallas / Fort Worth area was pummelled by a storm that damaged many buildings, left hundreds of thousands of people without power, and destroyed many trees. The tree pictured here is one such tree, found on the campus of UTDallas. The university facilities department has cleared away all debris and cut down all loose branches that were in danger of falling down, and have sanded many trees down to stumps for public safety. This tree is one of the only trees on campus that has been only PARTIALLY cut down.",
