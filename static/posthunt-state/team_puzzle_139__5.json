  "submissionText": "You are very welcome to share this photo with the world. The weather was horrible, it was raining, but the tree photo was worth it. \nFun fact: this is my neighbors tree. I don't think he liked when I took a photo with it. He looked outside nodding in disappointment at me hugging said tree. The tree is very pretty, and does a great job shading parts, but not all, of the ground. He's just working his 9-5 and really wants some extra PTO for next year. He's pretty tired, and really wants it to stop raining. Me too buddy, me too.  ",
