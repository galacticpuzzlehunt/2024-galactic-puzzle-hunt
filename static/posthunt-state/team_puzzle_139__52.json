  "submissionText": "Ok you guys are good, I'll do it...\n\nSo here's some fun facts about this tree:\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if it really is a tree, but it's like 4 meters high so I'm pretty sure it classifies as one?\nIt lives in my garden in Belgium!\nThis is the first time this tree ever got hugged* and I must say, it was an enjoyable hug.\nYes it was dark when I took the picture... you may force me to go outside, but you're not getting to fix my sleep schedule!! >:)\n\n* Don't quote me on that, there might be some kind of serial tree hugger going around in our neighbourhood, you never know for sure.",
