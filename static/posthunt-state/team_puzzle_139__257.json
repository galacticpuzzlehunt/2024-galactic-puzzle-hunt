  "submissionText": "Let me tell you a little story about James here. James and I grew up together on neighboring farms just outside of Brooklyn, Iowa. Things were tough back then, but we all got along well enough. We lived a nice, carefree life, sipping sarsaparilla in the sunset glow. \n\nAs we grew up, though, James changed. He got some big ideas in his head and moved off to California for college. We more-or-less drifted apart after that, but a few months ago I noticed a post by James about how his cancer treatment was going, and we reconnected. Fortunately he's now in remission, and we're back to reminiscing about those summers back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.",
